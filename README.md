# CSV-Parse-and-Strigify

## Quick Start
`CSV.parse(string)` can be used for convert a csv string to a 2-dimensional array.
```javascript
// const csv <- CSV String that was read from <input type="file"> and File API.

const arr = CSV.parse(csv);
```

`CSV.stringify(array)` can be used for convert a 2-dimensional array to a csv string.
```javascript
// const arr <- 2-dimensional Array that was created in your program or was received from a server such as Google Apps Script.

const csv = CSV.stringify(arr);
```
